# CircleCI Workshop in Python

This is [Praqma's CircleCI Workshop](https://github.com/praqma-training/circle-ci-workshop) ported to Python instead of using Java.
CircleCI is a continuous integration and build workflow tool offered as Software as a Service (SaaS). The purpose of Praqma's workshop is to introduce CircleCI while there is also some coding involved to complete the exercise.

The code in this repository is based on the following two repositories:
 - https://github.com/praqma-training/circle-ci-workshop

We use the XMLrunner which is a unittest test runner that can save test results to XML files in xUnit format so that the continuous integration system can pick them up.
